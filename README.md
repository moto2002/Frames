# Unity-UI-Layout
A set of Framer X-esque elements and tools for Unity 2018.3+.  Probably works on some earlier versions but I haven't tested it and don't plan to.

## Elements
### Frame
Frames are pretty much mostly boxes that can be used as content for stacks.

- Ability to change corner radius
- Ability to have split corner radiuses
- Ability to change level of detail
- Creation menu
- Custom inspector
- Superellipses!

### Stack
Basically just an easier-to-understand (and slightly dumbed down) version of Unity's linear Layout Group components.

#### More coming soon!

## Usage
In the GameObject menu, there's a folder called "Framer".  Create an element and have fun!
