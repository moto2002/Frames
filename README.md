# Unity-UI-Layout
A set of Framer X-esque elements and tools for Unity 2018.3+.  Probably works on some earlier versions but I haven't tested it and don't plan to.

## Elements
### Frame
Does nothing at the moment other than allow for stack rearranging.
#### Features included
- Creation menu

### Stack
Basically just an easier-to-understand (and slightly dumbed down) version of Unity's linear Layout Group components.
#### Features included
- Horizontal and vertical stacks
- Types of spacing, such as Start, Center, End, Space Between, Space Around, and Even Spacing
- Types of alignment, such as Left (Top), Center, and Right (Bottom)
- Padding
- Creation menu
- Frame element drag and drop to reorder
- Custom inspector with likely everything you'll need to use Stacks
