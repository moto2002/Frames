# Unity-UI-Layout
A set of Framer X-esque tools for Unity 2018.3+.  Probably works on some earlier versions but I haven't tested it yet.

### Frame
Does nothing at the moment other than allow for stack rearranging.

### Stack
Basically just an easier-to-understand (and slightly dumbed down) version of Unity's linear Layout Group components.
